{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. d4 {Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage
of Biel Grandmaster Tournament 2008. Magnus Carlsen won the last year's event
after a tiebreak match with Alexander Onischuk, but Yannick Pelletier had a
good tournament and beat Carlsen with Black. Perhaps we get to see this
Nimzo-Indian again :) Enjoy the game.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 $5 {
This time, Carlsen is avoiding the Nimzo-Indian.} b6 {Black can choose between
a variety of defenses, 3...c5 for Benoni or Bluemenfeld, 3...d5 for Queen's
Gambit Declined or 3...Bb4+ for Bogo-Indian. Of course, other transpositions
are possible as well. Pelletier wants to play Queen's Indian defence.} 4. g3 {
Tigran Petrosian invented the waiting and useful 4.a3 which Garry Kasparov
perfected later.} Ba6 5. Qc2 $5 {A modern way of dealing with Black's maneuver
Ba6-b7 where White is trying not to push b3 and prepares to sacrifice a pawn
instead. Aronian, Radjabov, Gelfand and Kramnik all tried this line.} Bb7 6.
Bg2 c5 7. d5 exd5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 ({The other way to take the pawn is} 8... Bxd5 {
but then White grabs some tempi for development, for example} 9. Nc3 Bc6 10. e4
d6 11. Bf4) 9. O-O Be7 10. Rd1 Nc6 {
Carlsen himself played 10... Qc8 against Peter Svidler recently.} 11. Qf5 Nf6
12. e4 {The most consistent follow-up after the aggressive Qf5.} (12. Nc3 {
has been tried in one game, but it appears too slow} O-O 13. e4 g6 14. Qf4 d6 {
and your commentator IM Miodrag Perunovic won this game with Black :)}) 12...
d6 ({More common is} 12... g6 {and now the game Carlsen-Ivanchuk 2007 continued
} 13. Qf4 O-O 14. e5 Nh5 15. Qg4 d5 16. exd6 Bf6 17. Nc3 Nd4 18. Nxd4 Bxg2 19.
Nf5 $1 {White eventually won.}) 13. e5 Qd7 {This plan of dealing with White
Queen has been tried only once, in Bareev-J.Polgar in the last year's
Candidate matches. Bareev convincingly won, but Peletier probably has some
improvement up in his sleeve.} 14. Qxd7+ Nxd7 15. exd6 Bf6 16. Re1+ Kf8 17. Nc3
{Black is usually giving the extra pawn back, in order to finish the
development without harm. After a short forced sequence, material is equal and
White d6 pawn is deep inside the enemy territory. As long as Black can't
attack it successfully, it goes into White's advantage because it is seriously
limiting Black's mobility. Pelletier still has to connect his Rooks.} Nb4 18.
Bg5 $5 {GM Krasenkow criticized this move in his annotations and suggested 18.
Rd1 with "plus/equal advantage to White". Carlsen might find the Rook move to
be too slow and suggests exchange sacrifice.} Nc2 $5 $146 {Novelty. Pelletier
accepts the challenge! White can continue with 19. Bxf6 Nxf6 20. Re7 or
sacrifice an exchange with immediate 19. Re7!?} ({Judit Polgar played} 18...
Bxf3 19. Bxf3 Rd8 20. Bxf6 Nxf6 21. Re7 {
but it ended bad after Bareev's Rook invaded the 7th rank.}) 19. Re7 $1 {
A daring exchange sacrifice, perfectly fitting with Carlsen's aggressive
playing profile. An important question is how will White recapture should
Black take on e7 (which seems like the only move). If 20. Bxe7+ then Black
King will be strained on g8, but White d6 pawn is still blocked by the Nd7 and
it is unclear if White can unlock it. 20. dxe7+ brings pawn one step closer to
the promoting square, but the main question is if Black will have time to
close the d-file with Bxf3 and Nd4. Very interesting position :)} ({
Krasenkow gave the following line} 19. Bxf6 Nxf6 20. Re7 Bxf3 21. Bxf3 Re8 22.
Rxe8+ Kxe8 {but White will have serious problems to keep the d6 pawn.}) 19...
Bxf3 $5 ({Pelletier sidesteps the most challenging} 19... Bxe7 20. Bxe7+ Kg8
21. Rd1 {with possible ideas of Ne5 and Nb5.}) 20. Bxf3 {The tempo on Ra8
allows White to trade on f6 and keep the Rook on the 7th rank. This now
resembles Bareev-Polgar and White is probably better.} Bxg5 ({Actually, on} 
20... Rd8 21. Bd5 {is devastating.} (21. Bxf6 Nxf6 {
would be like Bareev-Polgar game.})) 21. Rxd7 Rd8 22. Rxd8+ Bxd8 23. Rd1 {
Carlsen now enjoys stable advantage because Black pieces are poorlycoordinated.
Light-squared Bishop will prevent the blockade on d7 and d6 pawn will limit
Black Bishop. Nb5 is also in the air...} Nd4 24. Bg2 $5 {Nd4 is preventing
possible Bc6+, but if Black attempts to play Ke8, White can insert Nb5.} h5 $1
{Rook has to find a road to enter the play.} 25. a4 a6 26. Bb7 Rh6 $1 {
Of course, Pelletier would love to trade a6 for d6. Perhaps 24. Bg2 was played
a bit too quick. It is understandable that Carlsen wanted to keeptheopposite-c
oloured Bishops on the board, but with hindsight, 24. Kg2 looked better. In
that case, Bishop from f3 is eyeing h5 pawn.} 27. d7 Rd6 28. Bc8 (28. Bxa6 Rxd7
29. Kg2 {
White eventually has to move his King and prevent all kind of tactics...})
28... Nf3+ {This motif, while King is on g1, allows Black to trade off the
Rooks and reduce the pressure.} 29. Kg2 Rxd1 30. Nxd1 Ne1+ 31. Kf1 Nf3 32. h4
Ke7 33. Ne3 {It looks like a6 might be eventually traded for d7 and then Black
will be able to hold. 33...g6 and 33...Nd4 are good.} g6 34. Bxa6 Kxd7 35. Ke2
Ne5 $5 (35... Nd4+ $5 {with Bf6 next}) 36. f4 Ng4 {Pelletier is aiming for an
opposite-coloured Bishops ending...With no other pieces on the board, it is an
easy draw. Carlsen will probably avoid it.} 37. Bb5+ Ke7 38. Nd5+ Kd6 39. Bc4
Nh6 $1 {Pelletier is accurate in spite of being in slight time trouble. After
the possible Nf5, White weak pawn also comes under attack...} 40. Ne3 Bf6 41.
Bd3 Bd8 42. Kf3 {Maybe White will be able to push f4-f5 at the convenient
moment and after gxf5 recapture with the Bishop, offering N vs B ending.} Ng4
$5 43. Nxg4 {If White avoids the trade with 43.Nc4+ Kd5 then f4-f5 is not
possible because of contact between Kd5 and Nc4.} hxg4+ 44. Kxg4 Ke6 45. Bc4+
Ke7 46. Kf3 f5 47. Ke2 Kf8 48. Kd3 Bf6 49. b3 {
Bb2-c1-d2 looks like a timely maneuver to counter possible White's Kb5.} Bb2 $1
50. Bd5 Ba3 51. Kc4 Bb4 52. Kb5 Ba5 53. Bc4 (53. b4 $5 cxb4 54. Bb3 {is a very 
interesting attempt to create zugzwang, but Black can probably hold with
timely b6-b5 (when White King is on e5 or similar) and then Bb6-Bf2-Bxg3-Bxf4
when Bishop is controlling promotion square b8.}) 53... Ke7 54. Kc6 Kf6 55. Bd3
Kf7 $6 (55... Ke6 {
looks safer because the King is still with f5-pawn. If white plays} 56. g4 {
Black should be able to use the passed g-pawn as decoy and contain White pawns.
}) 56. h5 $1 gxh5 57. Bxf5 {
Now White has excellent winning chances because h5 is very weak.} Kf6 58. Be4
$1 {King will be tied for h5-pawn.} Kg7 59. Bf3 Kh6 60. Kb5 $1 Kg6 61. Bd1 Kh6
62. Be2 Kg6 63. Bf3 Kh6 64. Bc6 $1 {Final finesse! Now Black will be brought
into zugzwang after Be8-f7 and lose the h5-pawn. With the Bishop unfortunately
locked on a5, the resulting endgame is winning for White - Pelletier realized
this and threw the towel. After Black's mistake on 55th move, Carlsen used the
opportunity to win the first round of Biel International! It will be
interesting to analyze the position after 53. b4!?, maybe this was winning as
well. Thank you everyone for following Chessdom live commentary, have a nice
day.} 1-0

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. d4 {Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage
of Biel International 3rd round. Bacrot is very solid player who is mostly
angling for Marshall attack or Slav defence with Black pieces. Carlsen won
their last-round encounter at the Baku Grand Prix, but Bacrot was already on a
losing streak.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 $5 {Bacrot specialized in
Chebanenko Slav which features 4...a6, but he already lost in this line to
Evgeny Alekseev in the first round.} 5. Bg5 {Carlsen is aiming for the
sharpest lines in the Semi-Slav. 5. e3 would take the game into also popular
Meran defence.} Nbd7 $5 {Avoiding the ultra-sharp Botvinnik Slav with 5...dxc4
and Anti-Moscow with 5...h6 6. Bh4 dxc4. The selected Cambridge-Springs is not
without venom though. Vassily Ivanchuk also liked to use it from time to time.}
6. cxd5 $5 {Good practical decision to transpose into Exchange variation of
the Queen's Gambit Declined. After the main 6. e3 Qa5, White would have to
deal with pins against the King and possible tactics against Bishop on g5.}
exd5 7. e3 Be7 8. Qc2 Nh5 $5 {The "normal" 8...0-0 is more popular, but Bacrot
wants to solve the issue of dark-squared Bishops before turning to something
else. The tempi lost on this operation is not really significant as Black will
be able to complete his development.} 9. Bxe7 {Believe it or not, Vladimir
Kramnik played adventurous 9.h4 move against Garry Kasparov! It was in a blitz
game though, and it ended in a draw.} Qxe7 10. O-O-O {A move typical for
Carlsen, who will even in this "boring" Carlsbad pawn structure seek for an
opportunity to attack. The long castle was played in this position as early as
on 1928!} Nb6 11. h3 {
Loek Van Wely and Antoaneta Stefanova have tried 11.Ne5 here.} Be6 {Bacrot is r
ushing to castle long. Some other players, including Ivanchuk, have tried to
execute regular plan of 11...g6 with Ng7 (after White's Bd3) and Bf5.} 12. Bd3
O-O-O 13. Kb1 Kb8 14. Nd2 g6 {While White Knight is being transfered to the
queenside, Black is now building a post on f5. If 15. g4 Ng7, Black will
continue with h7-h5 which should bring some relief.} 15. Nb3 Ng7 16. f3 {
With idea to meet Be6-f5 with e4. This might cause some problems if Bacrot
manages to exploit now slightly weakened dark squares. 16...Nf5!? is looking
good.} Bf5 {Bacrot decided to provoke e4. The mighty-looking center could also
turn to be vulnerable, particularly if Black hits d4 somehow.} 17. Bxf5 {
This brings the Knight to f5 and Carlsen will have to spend some moves in
supporting e3 pawn or preparing e4-push. The point is that e3 is the forking
square for Qc2 and Rd1.} Nxf5 18. Rhe1 {18...Nxe3 is risky because Black Queen
is on the line with Re1 and Black will have hard time to untangle the pin.
After 18...Nc4 Carlsen will have to play Qc1 before trying to push e3-e4. This
gives some time to Bacrot to maybe even increase the pressure.} Nc4 19. Qc1 {
Bacrot is probably taking his time to double-check consequences of immediate
Nxe3. Safer road is 19...Qg5.} Qg5 {...and he decided not to test Carlsen's
calculating skills. It is still possible to play 20. g4 and drag Bacrot into
complications after Nxe3. 20. e4 Qxc1+ 21. Rxc1 dxe4 leaves White equal but
with broken pawns.} 20. g4 $5 {Risky and sharp, just like Magnus likes it.} Ng7
$5 {It is possible that Carlsen's huge energy and self-confidence sometimes
scare his opponents. Bacrot had more active possibilities, like Nxe3 or Nh4,
but he decided to retreat. This presents Carlsen with opportunity to
consolidate his pawn structure and transform it into real asset.} 21. f4 $5 {
Still following the narrow path! 21. e4 was safer but Carlsen wants to avoid
the trade of Queens when storming with pawns, even if it includes a pawn
sacrifice.} Qh4 22. e4 Qxh3 23. exd5 cxd5 {Probably only now Carlsen noticed
that intended 24. Nxd5 is met by sneaky 24...Qxg4! 25. Qxc4 Qf5+ and Black
regains the Knight.} 24. Nc5 {So he switches to different plan. The Knight is
adding on b7 and White wants to play Re7 if Black is greedy (Qxg4).} Ne6 $1 {
Better than allowing the unpleasant 24... Rhe8 25.b3 Nd6 26.Nxd5 Qxg4 27.Na6+}
25. b3 $1 {It is important to drive the Knight to weaker position before
dealing with d5 or executing some tactics against Black King.} Nxc5 {Bacrot had
a number of alternatives, but he decided to eliminate the Nc5 that was
breathing on his King's neck. However, now that d-file is open for White Rook,
it is no longer possible to rely on Qxg4-f5 in holding Nc4's position and if
White decides to push his b-pawn the Kb8 might again come under fire.} 26. dxc5
Na5 27. b4 {Exactly! Carlsen is not missing this chance.} Nc4 {
Bacrot is taking serious risk being short on time. Perhaps better was Nc6.} 28.
Nxd5 Na3+ 29. Ka1 $1 {
Precision! 29. Kb2 Qg2+ (attacking on Nd5) complicates matters.} Rhe8 $2 {
Re1-e3 was threatening, but now c5-c6! comes in with great force! Black is
immediately lost.} 30. c6 $1 bxc6 31. Qxc6 {Bacrot's position collapsed within
only a couple of moves! Probably already 25...Nc5 was imprecise and 27...Nc4
was serious mistake. Black was doing fine, perhaps he was even slightly better
at some point, but Carlsen's sharpness and persistence once again forced his
opponent to lose the control. Thank you everyone for following Chessdom live
coverage of Biel International, join us again for round 4 on Thursday at 14:00
CET (Tomorrow is rest day).} 1-0

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. d4 {Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage
of Biel International. Last year these two players have tied the first place
with 5.5/ 9 and after 2-2 in the tiebreaks, Carlsen won the Armageddon game to
claim the trophy. Onischuk, who has just been selected to represent USA at the
Chess Olympiad, is very solid player and makes use of all tactical chances.
Enjoy the game.} d5 2. c4 c6 $5 {Possibly a small surprise as Carlsen mostly
used Slav defence in fast time controls. The only regular tournament game that
I can recall at the moment is against Alexander Grischuk at the Baku Grand
Prix.} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4 Bf5 6. e3 {Grischuk used the sharper 6.Ne5}
e6 7. Bxc4 Bb4 8. O-O Nbd7 {Equally popular alternative is 8... O-O and then
the following line has been thoroughly researched 9.Qe2 Nbd7 10.e4 Bg6 11.Bd3
Bh5 12.e5 Nd5} 9. Qe2 Bg4 $5 {
9...0-0 or 9...Bg6 would probably transpose to the above-mentioned line.} 10.
h3 {Kramnik and Topalov have tested 10.Rd1 Qa5 11.e4} Bxf3 {Now 10... Bh5
takes away desired square from Black Queen (Qa5-h5) and White can prepare e4.
11.Rd1 O-O 12.e4} 11. Qxf3 O-O 12. Rd1 {Now that Nf3 is gone, it is generally
a good idea to overprotect d4 because Black is planning c5 or e5. ( On
immediate 12.e4 Black can just grab this pawn 12... Nb6 13.Bb3 Qxd4)} e5 $5 {
More direct than preparatory 12...Rb8 or 12...Qa5. The only way for White to
fight for the advantage is 13. d5 Bxc3!? 14. dxc6!? e4...} 13. d5 Bxc3 14. dxc6
e4 15. Qe2 Be5 {On cxd7 Black will move his Queen and play Rd8. White still
has some delay in completing the development and e4 pawn gives more space to
Black on the kingside. (15... bxc6 16.bxc3 might be nasty for Black after
White Bishops get to use open diagonals.)} 16. cxd7 Qe7 17. Ra2 $5 {Interesting
solution, after b2-b3, Rook will transfer to d2 and fight for the d-file.
Black will play Rd8-d7.} Rfd8 18. b3 Rxd7 19. Rxd7 Qxd7 {Better take with the
Queen without allowing Ba3 or Qg4. Black's only weak spot is f7, and as long
as White pieces are held on proper distance, Black is equal.} 20. Rd2 Qe7 21.
Rd1 h6 22. Qa2 $5 {With idea to play Ba3, and after later b3-b4, White has a
prepared battery against f7.} Rd8 {But after Rd1 was left unprotected, this
simple move solves all problems. Black Queen on the 7th rank will protect f7
forever.} 23. Rxd8+ Qxd8 24. Qd2 $5 {A draw offer?} Qe7 {Magnus says not yet..}
25. Qa5 $5 {Onischuk wants to force Black to move one of the queenside pawns
thus creating a possible weakness. But Black can ignore it for a second and
counterattack with 25...Qd6!?} b6 26. Qd2 a5 $5 {Preparing an outpost on c5.
Again, Carlsen is playing very fast. He has 80 minutes left on his clock.} 27.
Bb2 Bxb2 28. Qxb2 {It is still too early to move the Knight, because of
sensible pawns on e4 and f7, but Qd6 looks perfectly fine.} Kf8 $5 29. Qd4 Qc7
{Now that Black didn't play Qd6, White got a chance to centralize his Queen.
28...Qd6 29. Qd4 Qxd4 30. exd4 would have been slightly better endgame for
Black.} 30. Kf1 Ke7 {Preparing 31...Qc5, 32. Qxc5 dxc5 with Nf6-e8-d6. But not
31...Qd6 because it loses f7 pawn...} 31. Ke2 g5 $1 {The move is not that
strong as it shows Carlsen's intention to fight for a win. White's pawns
structure is still very solid and it's hard to find targets for attack. Black
Queen is tied for dark squares because it has to prevent Qe5+.} 32. g3 Qc5 {
It looks like White will have to trade the Queens, otherwise Qf5 is nasty.} 33.
Qxc5+ bxc5 34. f4 $5 {Good idea to provoke Black into trading his e4 pawn.
Isolated e3 would not be of great significance after White King gets some
extra squares to operate on. Of course, Black is not forced to take. Perhaps
34. f3 was more to the point?} Ne8 $5 35. g4 Nd6 36. Bd5 Kf6 {36... f5!? was
tempting, but Carlsen probably wants to maneuver for few moves longer before
committing to drastic structural changes.} 37. Kf2 Kg6 38. Kg3 f6 {This now rem
inded me of endgame from Saidy-Fischer when Black pretended to be "lazy" and
moved his pawns one square at a time. Of course, Onischuk's position is much
better then in mentioned game, besides he has good opportunity to push f4-f5
here.} 39. Be6 {Accompanied with draw offer, which Carlsen accepted. It would
be very hard to make progress without taking excessive risks. Thank you
everyone for following Chessdom live coverage of Biel International, see you
again on Friday, 14:00 CET, for the 5th round.} 1/2-1/2

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. e4 {Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage
of Biel Festival. The best Cuban player Leinier Dominguez joined the 2700 club
at the July FIDE list. He is great expert for Naidorf Sicilian and even Peter
Leko hired him as second for the 2007 World Championship in Mexico. However,
he also plays Petroff defence sometimes and he might use it to counter
Carlsen's usual aggression. On 1.d4 he is mostly using Slav defence. Enjoy the
game.} c5 {Sicilian after all! Carlsen already beat Dominguez in Naidorf at
the 2007 World Cup. The mini-match was better remembered by the Ruy Lopez
Chigorin-Marshall hybrid which Carlsen used in the other game (ended in draw).}
2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. h3 $1 {Even Bobby Fischer used
this move in the unforgettable game against Miguel Naidorf at the 1962 Varna
Olympiad. Those who don't want to castle short are even playing 6. Rg1!?} e6 7.
g4 b5 8. Bg2 {
The idea behind h3 was to setup a more aggressive fianchetto variation.} Bb7 9.
O-O Nc6 {Nakamura-Ninov and Karjakin-Van Wely saw White winning after 9... b4
10.Nd5! The position is full of danger, but if Black is careful, he should be
able to quickly equalize.} 10. Nxc6 Bxc6 11. Re1 $1 {
Again, Nd5 comes in if Black pushes b4.} Nd7 {But Dominguez is experienced
player and parries the tactics. 12. Nd5 is not that dangerous anymore because
Black will simply go back with Bb7 and threaten exd5, when there is no Nd4 to
jump on c6 or f5. Perhaps Carlsen could now transfer his Knight to d4 or play
a4.} 12. Nd5 $5 {Still, Carlsen plays it! Psychologically, this kind of moves
can be hard to meet. Your calculation shows there is nothing concrete, but
panic might sneak on the back door.} Bb7 13. Qd4 {The Queen is dominating the
center and prevents 13...exd5 because 14. exd5 Ne5 is met by f4 and 14. exd5
Be7 with 15. Qxg7. Maybe a "neutral" 13...Rc8 could be played? Then White has
to take care of c2 pawn.} Ne5 $5 {The idea is to chase White Queen away.} (
13... Rc8 $5 14. Qa7 (14. a4 $5 bxa4 (14... Rxc2 15. axb5 axb5 16. Nc3 $1))
14... Rb8) 14. f4 Nc6 15. Qf2 {15. Qb6 wo uld have saved the Knight, but
Carlsen wants to avoid the Queens' exchange for the time of being. Taking the
Knight on d5 might be dangerous, 15...exd5 16. exd5+ Ne7 17. f5!? with
possible Be3-b6 and Black has problems with coordination and development.} exd5
$5 {Dominguez knows which positions in Naidorf can be successfully defended.
It was already hard to untie the pieces and Black decided to take the risk.}
16. exd5+ Ne7 17. a4 $5 {Maintaining the pressure on both fronts, axb5 might
be convenient in some positions. f4-f5 should come in sometime soon.} Kd7 $5 {
A very brave King walk!! Black is not threatening to take on d5 as of yet,
because of nasty pins over the diagonal and axb5, he simply wants to find a
safer place for his King and untie the Knight. However, queenside can still
come under the attack of White's heavy artillery. This now becomes very
interesting.} 18. Be3 Bxd5 $5 {
Now that Bishop is on e3, Black can grab the pawn.} ({
The other capture was also interesting, with sample line} 18... Nxd5 19. axb5
axb5 20. Qe2 Bc6 21. Bxd5 Bxd5 22. Qxb5+ Bc6 23. Qf5+ Kc7 24. Rxa8 Qxa8 25.
Qxf7+) 19. Bb6 Qb8 $1 {It is important to keep an eye on Bb6. Carlsen will
probably continue 20. Rxe7+ Bxe7 21. Bxd5 where White still maintains strong
pressure.} 20. Rxe7+ Bxe7 21. Bxd5 Bh4 {Now it becomes obvious why Qb8 was
stronger than Qc8, 22. Qxh4 Qxb6+ is better for Black.} 22. Qd4 Bf6 23. Qf2 Bh4
24. Qd4 Bf6 {The problem is that Qe3 allows Re8 and even Re2 when Black might
take over the initiative. White is forced to agree on moves repetition. The
game was short but full of interesting variations. Thank you everyone for
following Chessdom live coverage, see you again on Saturday, 14:00 CET.}

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. d4 {Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage
of Biel International. Yannick Pelletier is currently last-placed with only 0.
5 points after five games. He will probably try not to force too much and stay
even. But Magnus Carlsen is playing very sharp and you can never know. Enjoy
the game.} Nf6 {
Carlsen played Slav defence in the 4th round game against Alex Onischuk.} 2.
Nf3 $5 {I know some people play this to avoid Budapest gambit :)} e6 3. c4 b6 {
Nevertheless, the players have reached the Queen's Indian defence. The opening
is very popular and was deeply explored over the recent years.} 4. g3 Ba6 {
The other main line 4... Bb7 has slower pace.} 5. b3 {5.Qc2!? with later pawn
sacrifice on d5 was tested in the games of Aronian, Gelfand and Kramnik. Even
Carlsen played it against Pelletier in the 1st round in Biel.} Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Be7
7. Bg2 d5 $5 {The other Biel participant, Evgeny Alekseev, likes to play this
way. The preparatory 7...c6 (with next d5) is much more popular, while some
Georgian players go with immediate 7...Bb7.} 8. cxd5 {
The most consistent reply. On other moves, like 8. Ne5, Black can play c6.}
exd5 9. Nc3 O-O 10. O-O Bb7 {Now that White has traded his c4-pawn, the Bishop
is not doing much on a6. Black is preparing c7-c5 and Bishop is needed on b7
to increase control over square e4.} 11. Rc1 Nbd7 12. Bf4 {White is also
improving his Bishop, by taking eye on c7-pawn and supporting future Nf3-e5.}
c6 {Peter Leko played the same way against Loek Van Wely at the Dortmund
Sparkassen few weeks ago. The immediate c5 is probably premature because White
could press the weaknesses with Nb5.} 13. Qc2 $5 {13. Ne5 is also consistent
with White's plans. Our friend Michael Roiz tested a slow but interesting plan
of 13. Ne1!? with idea Nd3-Bg5-Bxf6-e3 where White has good control in the
center, but somewhat rigid structure.} Re8 14. Rcd1 $5 {A curious setup for
Rooks. Levon Aronian played it once as introduction for a piece sacrifice and
he won that game against GM Huzman. Van Wely continued 14. Qb2 against Leko.
The Queen there stops Ba3 and supports future activities on e5.} Bb4 {
Huzman also played Bb4 but then went to chase White Bishop with Nh5. Aronian
simply supported it with e3 and sacrificed a piece for strong attack.} 15. Bd2
{
Pelletier is trying to maintain status-quo without committing himself too soon.
} (15. Ne5 {is not to be recommended} Nxe5 16. Bxe5 (16. dxe5 Ng4 {
trouble with e5 pawn.}) 16... Nd7 {
and if White moves the Bishop, Black will take on c3 and e2.}) 15... Rc8 16.
Qb2 Qe7 $1 {Now White is feeling pressured on e2 and Van Wely's plan of
advancing pawns on queenside is already ruled out.} 17. Rfe1 Qf8 $5 18. Bh3 {
Good move, to slow Black's regrouping down. Best would be not to allow Ne5 and
move the Rc8 immediately.} Rcd8 19. Qc2 $5 {Ok, he is definitely waiting :)} h6
20. Nh4 {Trying to make use of the "weakening" h6 and place the Knight on f5.
Kasparov said once that Knight safely nested on f5 is worth a pawn. Luckily
for Carlsen, he can chase it anytime with g6, but at the cost of further
weakening in the pawn structure. Now that White has abandoned center for a
moment, Black could use this chance to strike with c5.} c5 $1 {
20...Ne4!? was also worth of consideration, but c5 looks more to the point.}
21. Nf5 a6 {Now that c-pawn has advanced, Carlsen wants to cover b5-square.
His basic ideas are cxd4-Nc5 or immediate Ne4.} 22. Qb2 (22. a3 $5 {
was an interesting attempt, where} Bxa3 23. Nb1 Bb4 24. Bxb4 cxb4 25. Qc7 Ne4 {
gives excellent compensation to White. But Black is not forced to run into
this line and has 22...Bxc3 with Ne4 instead.}) 22... Bxc3 $5 {Carlsen is ly
changing the rhythm. This will probably transform the structure into hanging
pawns.} 23. Bxc3 Ne4 24. dxc5 Nxc3 25. Qxc3 bxc5 26. Qa5 $5 {A neat way to
block the queenside. White is also threatening Qc7. But since White Rook is
not on its "natural" square - c1, Black has time for Nf6 and Ne4 (if needed).}
Nf6 27. Qb6 {This only helps Black to make a pin on c8-h3 diagonal.} ({
Probably better was to press on c5-pawn with} 27. Rc1 Ne4 28. Bg2) ({
The tempting} 27. Nxh6+ $2 {is losing because} gxh6 28. Qb6 Qd6 29. Qxb7 Re7 {
White Queen ends trapped.}) 27... Bc8 $1 28. Kg2 {A sad necessity.} (28. Nxh6+
{fails to} gxh6 29. Bxc8 Rd6 $1) 28... Ne4 $1 {Preventing all kind of Nxh6
tricks and threatening Ng5 or Nc3 or g6-Bxh3-Nxf2. Black is clearly better
after White's premature Qb6.} 29. f3 Ng5 $1 {White has serious problems with
his minor pieces, all consequence of allowing Black to play Bc8. Equally
strong was 29... Nc3!} 30. g4 (30. Bg4 g6 31. Nh4 Bxg4 32. fxg4 {
with catastrophic pawn weaknesses.}) 30... h5 $1 {Breaking the pawn wall
around White King. Black heavy pieces will soon invade over 'e' and maybe even
'h' file. Pelletier is down to one minute on the clock for the remaining 10
moves, while Carlsen has almost one hour.} 31. Rc1 g6 32. Ng3 {The straightforw
ard 32. ..Nxh3 33. Kxh3 hxg4+ 34. fxg4 Qh6+ looks like a way to go. On the
other hand, the nasty 32...Ne6! might be even stronger!} Nxh3 33. Kxh3 hxg4+
34. fxg4 Qh6+ 35. Kg2 Bxg4 {White is simply lost.} 36. Qxc5 $6 {
Allowing Rc8 and Rxe2+!} Re3 {Carlsen takes a different course, pilling his
pieces near the enemy King. The Rook will probably take on g3 at some point.} (
36... Rc8 37. Qa3 Rxe2+ 38. Rxe2 $1 (38. Nxe2 Qh3+ 39. Kg1 Qe3+ 40. Kg2 Bh3+ {
is checkmate soon.}) 38... Rxc1 {ThreateningQh3+}) 37. Qd4 Qh3+ 38. Kg1 Rxg3+
39. hxg3 Qxg3+ 40. Kh1 Bf5 $1 {Pelletier has reached the time control, but his
position is hopeless. Update: Few minutes later he resigned! A wonderful
attacking game after Pelletier erred on 27th move. This leaves the Swiss
player knocked on the bottom of the crosstable with 0.5 points only. Carlsen
will remain alone in the lead if Bacrot holds against Alekseev. Thank you
everyone for following Chessdom live commentary. Note that tomorrow is rest
day, see you again onMonday!} 0-1

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com) Good day everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage of Biel
International. Alekseev won one game against Carlsen back in the 2004 at the
junior event, but all of their recent games ended in draws. It is possible
that they will continue discussion in the Queen's Indian defence. Enjoy the
game!} 1. e4 {No QID this time.} e5 {Nowadays, on the top level e5 is almost
more popular than Sicilian defence. The main reason is that White still
haven't found clear ways to achieve advantage against Ruy Lopez Marshall
attack.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {Berlin variation, revived by Vladimir Kramnik.
It helped him win the World Championship match against Garry Kasparov and
other players followed his footprints.} 4. d3 $5 {A relatively new approach,
adopted from players who hate to play with microscopic advantage in the main
line.} ({The main line:} 4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8.
Qxd8+ Kxd8) 4... Bc5 5. Nc3 $5 {The position now resembles some variations of
Four Knights opening, rather than Ruy Lopez. The more flexible solution is to
castle and keep the option of playing c3. Carlsen obviously has different
intentions. GM Emil Sutovsky liked to play 5. Bxc6 here.} O-O {It is interestin
g to point that Alekseev himself played this position with White, last month
at the Foros Aerosvit. In the game against Pavel Eljanov, he continued 6. 0-0
and after Nd4 we saw a classical Rubinstein counterattack in the Four Knights.
That game finished in quick draw. Mikhail Chigorin played 6. Bg5!?} 6. Bxc6 $5
{Carlsen goes another way.} dxc6 {The pawn structure is similar to the Ruy
Lopez exchange variation, but the difference is that Black didn't play a6 and
it will be harder for White to prepare d4. On the other hand, Black Knight
would be much happier on e7.} 7. Nxe5 $5 {Now this is brave! White is picking
up the fight before bringing the King into security. Black can play 7...Bxf2+
8. Kxf2 Qd4+ 9. Be3 Qxe5 or immediate 7...Qd4 8. Be3 Qxe5 9. d4 with dxc5. 7.
h3 was safer.} Qd4 ({The other capture also looked promising, sample line} 7...
Bxf2+ 8. Kxf2 Qd4+ 9. Be3 Qxe5 10. h3 Nh5 $1 11. Qf3 f5 12. d4 Qe8 13. e5 f4 {
With excellent play for Black.}) 8. Be3 Qxe5 9. d4 Qe7 10. dxc5 Nxe4 {
The last few moves were forced. Now 11. Nxe4 Qxe4 12. 0-0 Be6 causes some
problems to White, because Queen has to defend c2 and Black Rooks will quickly
grab the open files.} 11. Qd4 $5 {
Probably better than exchange on e4 because now White could castle long!?} Bf5
(11... Nxc3 12. Qxc3 Rd8 $5 13. O-O $2 Be6 {
With idea Rd5-Rad8 would have been equal.}) 12. O-O-O {Alright! This helps
White to protect sensitive c2-pawn and fight better for the d-file (King
controlling d1). The drawback is that kingside pawns, that are not protected
by the King, might come under attack. Still, White could drop one of them if
opening of the files will help in pressuring the Black King.} Rad8 13. Qb4 {
Winning the tempo against b7-pawn. Now if 13...b6, maybe 14. Qa3!? touching on
a7? For this reason, 12...Rfd8 might have been more precise.} Qe6 $5 {
A fine small push that highlights some of the weaknesses in White's camp. The
main threat of Nxc3 and Qxa2 forces White to do something about it. 14. Kb1
might not be the best way since White is losing some of the control on the
d-file. 14. a3 allows b6 since Queen's desirable square is taken away. Most
likely, Carlsen will exchange one or two pairs of pieces to reduce Black's
tactical possibilities and continue playing on the structure.} 14. Kb1 $5 {
Carlsen wants to keep as many pieces on the board as possible. He might not
have double Rook's exchange at the disposal, but there are other possibilities.
14...Qg6 is indirectly pressuring on the weak c2.} (14. Nxe4 $5 Bxe4 ({But not
} 14... Qxe4 15. Qxe4 Bxe4 16. f3 Bd5 17. Bf4 $1 {
when White is slightly better.}) 15. Rxd8 Rxd8 16. Rd1 Rxd1+ 17. Kxd1 {
with roughly equal ending.}) 14... b5 {The threat is a7-a5, and after White
takes, Black plays Ra8, Nxc3 and takes on a2.} 15. b3 {This weakening is
serious concession. Nc3 might become loose and White will probably trade it
soon.} Qe5 {15... Qg6!? is posing bigger problems because g2 is also under
attack 16.Nxe4 Bxe4 17.Qc3 b4! 18.Qc4 Qxg2 19.Rhg1 Rxd1+} 16. Nxe4 Bxe4 17. Bd4
Qf5 18. Qc3 {18. Rd2 was also fine. The position is now completely equal.} f6
19. f3 Bd5 20. Rhe1 ({The daring pawn hunt with} 20. Qa5 $5 {
allows Black to gain nice counterplay} Bf7 21. Rhe1 (21. Qxa7 $2 Bg6 {and Rd4})
21... Bg6 22. Rd2 Qf4) 20... Rd7 {Both players will spend a couple of moves on
solidifying the position. Alekseev wants to double the Rook and maybe transfer
the Bishop to g6, while Carlsen will play Kb2 and move the (in some positions
hanging) Bishop from d4.} 21. Bf2 Rfd8 22. Rd4 h5 {Taking g4 under control and
giving some air to the King. The Bishop will probably move to g6 in the future.
} 23. h3 {Is he insisting on g4? It is possible that Black will face the "how
to improve beautiful position" paradox that was so nicely explained in books
of GM Suba.} Bf7 24. g4 hxg4 25. hxg4 Qg5 {
Some progress here, Queen was forced away from the ideal diagonal.} 26. Kb2
Rxd4 27. Bxd4 Qd5 28. Rd1 $1 {Exclamation mark only because White is not
afraid to go under the pin. With Bishop on d4, f4-g5 might be a good plan. The
alternative was 28. Bf2} b4 $1 {Excellent reaction. Trying to drive the Queen
from this diagonal and swap b-pawn for very important f3.} 29. Qxb4 (29. Qe3 $5
Re8 30. Qf4) 29... Qxf3 30. Rd2 {Idea is 30...Qxg4 31. Bc3!?} (30. Rg1 {
allows Queen's trade after Qe4.}) 30... Qxg4 31. Bc3 Qc8 32. Rg2 Bd5 {
The certain pressure against Black King is compensating for the pawn deficit.}
33. Rg1 Qf5 {Maybe chance for Qb7?} 34. Qb7 Kf7 35. Qxc7+ {Another possibility
was to take a7-pawn and push the passer sometime in the future. Obviously,
Carlsen wanted to have his Queen near the enemy King.} Rd7 36. Qc8 Be4 {
The only move! Allowing Qh8 would have been very dangerous. Now Black will
have Qh7.} 37. Qh8 Qh7 38. Qc8 Qf5 39. Rf1 $5 Qe6 $5 (39... Qxf1 40. Qxd7+ Kf8
{looks like a draw.} (40... Kg8 $4 41. Qe8+ Kh7 42. Qxe4+)) 40. Qh8 Re7 {
The show goes on.} 41. Rd1 Re8 42. Qh2 Bf5 43. Rd2 (43. Rd6 {allows} Qe2 {
and Magnus wants those heavy pieces on the board.}) 43... Re7 44. Qb8 Rd7 {
It was about time Alekseev to try exchanging the Rooks and soften c2 defence.
But this might not be the best way to do it, since White has 45. Rd6 and then
Qe2 is met by Rxd7 (which was not possible in the line given above).} 45. Rf2
Bg6 46. Rh2 Qe8 (46... Qe4 $5) 47. Qg3 Qe4 {
This is the best square for the Queen. It protects Bg6 and attacks on c2.} 48.
Rg2 Re7 49. Rd2 Rb7 {
Odd-looking move, but it doesn't change the assessment. Still dead equal.} 50.
Qh2 Re7 51. Qb8 Bf5 52. a4 {Finally, a pawn is moved :) It is hard to make any
progress though, as long as Alekseev is firmly pressing on c2.} Bg6 53. a5 Bf5
54. a6 Bg6 55. Qg3 Bf5 56. Rg2 Bg6 57. Rh2 Bf5 58. Qb8 {White is trying to
sneak in through the 8th rank, but even simple Kg6 keeps Black intact.} Bg6 59.
Ka3 Bh7 60. Rd2 Bf5 61. Qh8 Qe3 62. Kb2 Qe4 63. Rf2 Qg4 64. Qh2 Bg6 65. Qd6 Qe6
66. Qxe6+ $5 Kxe6 67. Ba5 {The Queens have left the board, and this is now
interesting endgame. White might be planning to check on e2, trade the Rooks
and play Bb6.} Be4 {Covering the possible check and taking c6 under protection.
} 68. c4 g5 {It is too early to speculate who will be faster in this race, but
Black pawn have a clear road ahead...} 69. Bd2 Rg7 70. Re2 f5 71. b4 g4 72. b5
cxb5 73. cxb5 g3 74. Re1 {Hoping to block the promoting square. Immediate 74.
b6 was also interesting, White sacrifices Bishop for pawn, but his own pawns
are very close to promotion.} Kd5 75. Be3 {Probably immediate b6 was better.}
Bd3 $1 {Exactly, now Black grabs the advantage.} 76. Rd1 Ke4 77. Rxd3 Kxd3 78.
Bg1 f4 79. b6 f3 80. b7 Rg8 $1 {
This is the crucial tempo, White has to push c-pawn, but it's too late...} 81.
c6 f2 82. c7 fxg1=Q 83. c8=Q Qd4+ 84. Ka2 {And Carlsen resigned seeing that 84.
.. Rxc8 and 85...Qc4+ is winning for Black. An odd game, where nothing
happened for about 30 moves and then White decided for a sudden pawn race.
Black turned to be faster because his pawns had no obstacles on the way. Thank
you everyone for following Chessdom live commentary, see you again tomorrow at
14:00 CET.} 0-1

with his favorite move ! With this move he succeeded so many nice wins
especially if black continues with 4...b6.Lets have a look and see what
currently one of the best world players has prepared....} c5 {this move will
transpose game into g3 system against Nimzo if Bacrot opts for it. Besides 5.
g3 , recommend is also 5.e3 which would lead to sort of Karo Kan - Panov
variation.} 5. g3 {
Exactly what we expected! This game will be very interesting!} cxd4 6. Nxd4 O-O
7. Bg2 d5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 9. Qb3 Qa5 10. Bd2 Nc6 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. O-O Bxc3 {
Carlsen is repeating his game vs Jakovenko from Moscow memorial in 2007. In
that game he managed to win, but still Jakovenko had slightly better position
most of the middlegame. Let's see if he prepared anything ....} 13. bxc3 Ba6 {
Exactly what he's played in that game . Jakovenko now went with 14.Rfd1,
although 14.Qc2!? might be interesting aswell!?} 14. Rfd1 Qc5 {Nice positional
move that allows black to play Bc4 with blockade after Bc4 and also moves
queen away from potential c4 tricks.} 15. e4 Bc4 16. Qa4 Nb6 17. Qb4 Qh5 {
Of course that black must not trade queens due to pair of bishops advantage
for white.} 18. Bf4 c5 $5 {This is a very critical moment of the game, where
Carlsen is repeating exactly the same game as he had vs Jakovenko last year.
Interesting possibilities that have been used are 18...e5!? and 18...Be2.} (
18... e5 $5 19. Be3 Be2 20. Re1 Nc4 21. Qc5 Rfd8 {Najer - Jakovenko RUS-ch
super final where black managed to win in really messy game.}) (18... Be2 19.
Re1 c5 20. Qb3 e5 {where after} 21. Bc1 $1 {
Grischuk nicely outplayed Gelfand in positionally deep rook ending!}) 19. Qb2
Rad8 20. Rxd8 Rxd8 $146 {Novelty! In above mentioned game Jakovenko played 20.
Re1!?- giving up of d file, but in order to keep all rooks on the board and to
have full control of important e2 square....Although I think Bacrot's move is
deeply analyzed in his own kitchen, so let's have a look who is better
prepared and who's gonna take advantage of better opening knowledge.} 21. f3 {
makes pawns being connected and he hopes for Re1, h4 and Be3 plan, where white
hopes to exploit pair of bishops advantage on long term.} f5 {The best reaction
! This move breaks quite flexible and strong white pawns and leads into
complications. Although, don't forget , after ef5 Qf5 , black will have to
face big positional problems, lack of pair of bishops, isolated a7 , c5 and e6
pawns! White gets a nice position!} 22. exf5 Qxf5 {22...ef5 was out of
consideration mainly because of weak pawns on a7 and c5 after 23.Qa3!} 23. Re1
{This move just points out e6 weakness and controls e5 square.At some point
white might take advantage of Qa3 , and Re5 ideas.Also . h4 preventing any
kind of wild g5 would be also nice for white.} Qd5 {Interesting move. Black
attacks pawn on a2, but much more important is the fact that the queen may go
to c6 or b7 where it's going to defend a7 and c5 pawns. Very strong home
preparation for Bacrot and unless Carlsen comes up with something else, he
will have to start to defend very soon. Possibilities are 24.Qa3 or more
natural 24.h4 with idea to release rook on e1 (to go for example on e5)and to
create h2 shelter for its king.} 24. Qa3 {Bacrot wants to play against
weaknesses. From that point of view Qa3 looks very strong since Qa7 is
currently threat but also h4 with Re5....Carlsen will have to look up for some
active defensive moves like...Qc6 or Rd7.} Qc6 {Active defense! Carlsen is
hoping for 25.Qa7 Ra8 26. Qe7 Nd5 27.Qg5 Nf4 28.Qf4 and after 28...Ba2
position is equal.Beside that pretty drawish alternative, white has 25.Be3 or
still 25.h4!?} 25. Qxa7 {This will transpose game into equal ending but maybe
Bacrot saw something more than above written variation....} Ra8 26. Qe7 Nd5 27.
Qd6 {Bacrot is willing to play slightly better ending where pair of bishops
should decide , although , material will be so reduced that I doubt any of
sides will be in chance to win after Qd6 28.Bd6 Nc3 29.Bc5 Ra2} Qxd6 28. Bxd6
Nxc3 29. Bxc5 Rxa2 {Arising position with only one weakness in black's
structure on the board is not enough for white to materialize its advantage.
Also, pair of bishops without pawn on both sides of the board can not be
exploited in its full strength.} 30. Bf1 {this move shows Bacrot's unambitious
intentions inn this game.I am still regreting for not trying 24.h4!? since
black's position would be very hardly defendable thereafter.} Bxf1 31. Kxf1 Kf7
{Draw, a bit disappointing ending by white. Although, we have to admit that
both players should be satisfied with outcome of this game, Bacrot - because
he managed to get draw against currently the best world player and for Carlsen
who managed to hold dangerous Bacrot with black and to recover after loss in
previous round. Thank you for following the game live with Chessdom.com. See
you tomorrow!} 1/2-1/2

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. e4 c5 {At the 2007 World Cup, when Carlsen eliminated
Dominguez, he used an interesting Ruy Lopez hybrid to earn a draw with Black
pieces. This time we'll have Sicilian. Maybe Dragon, the latest addition to
Carlsen's repertoire?} 2. Nf3 g6 $5 {We're already used to seeing Carlsen
introducing new stuff into his openings in key moments. Currently, he is
trailing Dominguez by full point, and he clearly wants to win and catch him on
the crosstable. This move order can lead to it's unique setups, but numerous
transpositions are also possible.} 3. d4 Bg7 {Carlsen himself played 4. Nc3,
while Ivanchuk tested all kinds of moves, including 4. d5 and 4. c3.} 4. Nc3
cxd4 5. Nxd4 {Dominguez makes practical decision, avoid all mind-games and
take the position into familiar system - Accelerated Dragon.} Nc6 6. Be3 Nf6 7.
Bc4 ({A modest 7.Be2 also had its share of popularity} 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5 9.
exd5 Nxd5 {this position was first seen in Tarasch-Lipke, 1898! Later, Tarasch
"improved" Black's play with 9...Nb4, but both moves remained equally used in
the practice.}) 7... O-O (7... Qa5 $5 {forces White to remain within
Accelerated Dragon. By the way, in former Yugoslavia (and I believe in other
Eastern European countries) AD is called Simagin Sicilian, after the great
innovator who popularized this setup and was one of the pioneers in exploring
the "Sicilian exchange sacrifice".} 8. O-O O-O 9. Bb3 d6) 8. Bb3 d6 {
Now the game definitely transposes into Sicilian Dragon...} (8... a5 $5 9. f3 (
9. a4 $5) 9... d5 $5) 9. f3 Bd7 10. Qd2 Rc8 {The first crossroad. There are
numerous alternatives to Rc8, for example 10...Nxd4 (with next b5), 10...Qa5
or 10...Ne5.} 11. O-O-O {11.h4!? can be considerably sharper. Radjabov played
this way against Carlsen at the recent Baku Grand Prix and lost after forcing
too much.} Ne5 12. Kb1 a6 $5 {Novelty for Carlsen's games. Earlier he used 12.
.. Re8!? against Karjakin and Leko and drew both games. The most popular is 12.
..Nc4. Update: Dominguez is still thinking, he must be very surprised with
this rare move. The most obvious continuations are 13. h4 which will probably
be met with h7-h7, and 13. g4 b5. He knows this, but he still has to estimate
the resulting positions and compare them to already familiar procedures.} 13.
h4 $5 {Probably the most challenging for Black's "slow" a6.} h5 14. g4 $5 {
Now this is very aggressive! Exactly what Carlsen was hoping for (unless he
ends checkmated :)). 14. Bg5!? or 14. Bh6 were viable alternatives.} hxg4 15.
h5 ({Also interesting is} 15. f4 Nc4 16. Bxc4 Rxc4 17. e5 $5 Nh5 $5) 15... Nxh5
16. Bh6 {There are similar positions in Dragon Sicilian, but without Kb1 and
a6 included. The question is how it matters and who could possibly benefit
from it.} e6 {A very important defensive move. Taking away square d5, closing
the diagonal for Bb3, and in some variations control of square g5 could be
crucial.} 17. Rdg1 Qf6 (17... g3 $5 18. Rxh5 $5 gxh5 19. Rxg3 Ng6 20. Nf5 {
looked too risky for Black.}) 18. fxg4 Bxh6 19. Qxh6 {Now we see one of the
advantages of Kb1 inclusion. There is no more forcing Queen's exchange since
19...Qf4 is not check.} Qg7 20. Qe3 Nf6 21. g5 {After the forced line, Black
has emerged with extra pawn and White still has a strong pressure on the
kingside. The position could be evaluated as roughly equal, but with lots of
possibilities for both sides.} Nh5 22. Nde2 $5 {Probably aiming to exchange
the Nh5, but it might prove to be too slow. Dominguez should be careful as 22..
.b5 and next a7-a5 might cause problems on the queenside.} a5 $5 {Dominguez pro
bably contemplating over 23. Rxh5 exchange sacrifice and next Nf4. Black can
fend the attack off, but precision will be required.} 23. Rxh5 $1 {
"!" for bravery :)} gxh5 24. Nf4 {Black pieces might turn to look clumsy,
particularly if White Knight reaches f6. Still, King on g7 or g6 should be
safe in most of the lines. Sometime Black can even counter-sacrifice on c3 and
play for a slightly better endgame.} Ng4 $5 {Intending counterattack? Queen's
diagonal is open and Rxc3 comes handy. Engines preferred the "ugly" Qh8, but
it is hardly to be expected from a human.} 25. Qh3 {Probably the best. Other
Queen moves would allow a burst of Black's energy. For example 25.Qf3 Qd4!
when there are certain problems with the back rank and next Rc8-c5 threatens
to capture g5.} Qd4 (25... Rxc3 $5) 26. Nce2 $1 {Now this is totally different
because White can capture on h5 with his Queen as well.} Qxe4 {The only move,
which is also guarding h7 in case if White plays Qxh5. But 27. Nxh5 is much
stronger and Black will be facing huge problem.} 27. Qxh5 $6 {Dominguez was
with at least 15 minutes on the clock, it is hard to believe that he didn't
see Nxh5. Now Carlsen has a chance to come back into the game. Rh1 is not
really a threat, Black can play Kg7...} a4 $1 28. Rh1 {Actually, I stand
corrected, 28..Kg7 is met by 29. Ng3! and Queen loses control over h7. Always
look one move deeper :)} Qxh1+ {Then this is the only way...But Black will
have two Rooks for a Queen and he should be fine once (if) his King is
consolidated.} 29. Qxh1 axb3 30. axb3 Bc6 {Aiming to take the b1-h7 diagonal.}
(30... e5 $6 31. Nd5) 31. Qh4 Be4 {Right on time to protect the Knight, since
32. Qxg4 loses to Bxc2+. Still, Nh5-f6 is a serious threat.} 32. Nc3 Bf5 33.
Nh5 f6 {Everything else was losing. If White takes on f6, Black will play Kf7.
34. Ng3, hitting Bf5, looks nasty.} 34. Ng3 $1 {Dominguez is down to only few
minutes on the clock but he finds the strongest move.} Rc7 {Black didn't have
much choice, the 7th rank should be protected in case of Nxf5 and g6.} 35. Nxf5
exf5 36. gxf6 ({But not} 36. Nd5 Rh7 $1 37. Qe1 {
The only move, otherwise Rh1+ and Ra8+} fxg5 {and Black escapes.}) 36... Nxf6
37. Qg5+ Kf7 38. Qxf5 Re7 39. b4 $5 {Important step in preventing all kinds of
back-rank trouble. The King gets some air.} Re5 40. Qf2 {Dominguez was in
serious time trouble while playing the last couple of moves. Now the time
control has passed and he can plan on how (if possible) to exploit the small
advantage.} Rd8 41. b3 Rd7 42. Kb2 Rde7 43. Qb6 Rd7 {Black is well coordinated
to protect his pawns and prevent Nd5. Perhaps Dominguez missed an opportunity
to transfer the Knight to d4 with 41. Ne2.} 44. Qd4 Ke7 45. Qd3 {Maybe attempti
ng Ne2... Black pawns are weak, but the play is ongoing on the small front and
it is hard to use the long-range powers of White Queen.} Kf7 46. Nb5 Ke7 47.
Nd4 Kf7 {Quite funny, now Carlsen does the same, repeating two moves, that
Alekseev did against him two days ago.} 48. Qf3 Rh5 49. Nf5 Ke6 50. Nd4+ Kf7
51. Nf5 Ke6 52. Nd4+ {Carlsen can claim the threefold repetition with Kf7.
However, he should do it before he moves, in order to avoid the
misunderstanding that occurred in the game against Emil Sutovsky at the 2007
ETCC.    Update: And the draw has been agreed. A very interesting game where
both players missed their chances. It looks like 27. Nxh5 was crushing, and
even though Dominguez played all the best moves since, he was unable to
convert the advantage after Carlsen's persistent defence. Dominguez maintains
the full point lead before the last round. Thank you everyone for following
Chessdom live coverage, see you again tomorrow at 14:00 CET.} 1/2-1/2

{Live commentary by IM Miodrag Perunovic and Goran Urosevic (taken from www.
chessdom.com)} 1. e4 {Hello everyone, welcome to the Chessdom live coverage of
the last round of Biel International. Last year Magnus Carlsen and Alexander
Onischuk have played a tiebreak match to determinate the winner, but this time
Cuban star Leinier Dominguez is in best position to claim the trophy. Onischuk
might be a bit tired after a long series of tournaments (Foros, Poikovsky) and
Carlsen will certainly play for a win. Enjoy the game!} e5 {
Last year Carlsen opened with 1.d4 and won in the Queen's Gambit Declined.} 2.
Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 $5 {Probably played with
intention to avoid Onischuk's favorite Marshall attack. Transpositions are
still possible though. It is interesting to note that Carlsen also used the
"quiet" d3 against Alekseev's Berlin defence.} d6 7. c3 O-O 8. Nbd2 Re8 9. Re1
Bf8 {They are blitzing through the opening... Onischuk is delaying b7-b5,
which still allows Bxc6. The defect in the pawn structure would be compensated
with pair of Bishops and excellent play over the files "b" and (soon) "e".
Carlsen keeps the Bishop and more options at hand.} 10. Nf1 h6 {Better to preve
nt Ng5 on time, before f7 becomes vulnerable. Black Bishop will be
fianchettoed after some delay, while Re8 is ready for d4 which will White play
sooner or later.} 11. Ng3 b5 12. Bc2 {Carlsen already had this position in one
game at the 2004(!) Norway Championship. Most commonly Black continue with
natural g6, but some players, like Dmitry Jakovenko and Mateusz Bartel, have
tried immediate d5!?} d5 $5 13. d4 $1 {Others used to play cautious h3 or a4,
but Carlsen immediately strikes back in the center, in the spirit of his
earlier game vs IM Elsness. On 13...dxe4 14. Nxe4 Bf5 he will probably play 15.
d5!? again. 13...Bg4 also deserves attention since White didn't have time to
play h3. Other moves are probably inferior.} dxe4 {If you are wondering why is
Carlsen taking this long to move, he is probably down in the Open section
watching the games of his friends :) 15. d5 given in the previous comment
wouldn't be good because Black didn't play g6 and there is no trick with 15.
d5 Nxd5 16. Qxd5 Qxd5 17. Nf6+, so probably immediate 15. Nxf6+ is best.} 14.
Nxe4 Bf5 15. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {Too late for d5, as Black has excellent reply in
e5-e4! after the square has been cleared. There will be further exchanges,
either on f5 or on e5.} 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 (16... Bxc2 17. Qxc2 Nxe5 18. dxe5 Rxe5
19. Rxe5 Qxe5 {would have been similar to the game continuation.}) 17. dxe5
Rxe5 {The position is equal.} 18. Rxe5 Qxe5 19. Be3 Bxc2 20. Qxc2 {Already tomo
rrow Carlsen is playing at the 13th Grenkeleasing Rapid World Championship in
Mainz, together with Anand, Morozevich and J. Polgar.} Rd8 21. Rd1 Rxd1+ 22.
Qxd1 Bd6 23. g3 Qe4 24. Bd4 f5 $5 {Onischuk is trying to find motifs to play
for a win. Moving the pawn to g3 created small weakness, but it is nothing
significant and the play is still completely equal.} 25. a3 Be5 26. Bc5 Qc4 27.
Ba7 Bf6 28. Kg2 c6 29. Be3 Qe4+ 30. Kg1 a5 31. Bf4 a4 32. h3 Qd5 33. Qe2 {
Isolated pawn after Queen's exchange 32. Qxd5+ cxd5 would not guarantee
advantage to White because Black can cover all of his weaknesses.} Qe4 34. Qd1
Qd5 35. Qe2 Qe4 36. Qd1 {And game is drawn after the three-fold repetition.
Neither of the players can improve the position. Carlsen completed the
tournament with 6.0/10 and is packing his bags on the way to Mainz. Onischuk
finished with 4.0. This completes our coverage of the Biel International,
thank you everyone for following the commentary on Chessdom.com. See you soon!}
